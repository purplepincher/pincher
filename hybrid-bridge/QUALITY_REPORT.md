## 5. Source Code Analysis

### 5.1 `src/engine.rs` — MatrixEngine, VetoEngine, HybridEngine

**Findings from Claude Code deep analysis:**

| Issue | Severity | Status | Detail |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| `blocking_read()` in async `get_portfolio` | **HIGH** | ✅ **FIXED** | Was using `blocking_read()` in `DefaultVetoEngine::get_portfolio()`, which blocks the tokio executor thread. Changed to `self.current_portfolio.read().await`. |
| Semaphore ineffective in `phase_rooms` | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Noted | Semaphore permits are acquired/released in a sequential loop, never actually limiting concurrent room analysis. `tokio::spawn` needed for true concurrency. |
| Empty snapshot on non-full cycles | LOW | ⚠️ Noted | Non-full cycles produce a zero-filled `MatrixSnapshot` passed to room agents. Edge case for room analysis correctness. |
| `VetoEngine::freeze/unfreeze` uses `&mut self` | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Noted | Impedance mismatch with `Arc<RwLock<V>>` wrapper in `HybridEngineImpl`. Interior mutability via `RwLock` delegates correctly but the trait signature is restrictive. |

**Verdict:** One critical issue found and fixed. The engine is structurally sound for production use with known lower-severity design notes.

### 5.2 `src/chaos.rs` — NaN/Inf Injection & Recovery

**Findings:**

- ✅ `detect_non_finite()` and `mask_non_finite()` are **correct** — `!val.is_finite()` catches NaN, +Inf, and -Inf.
- ⚠️ `SAFE_MODE_THRESHOLD = 1` is very aggressive. For large tensors, a single corrupted cell triggering safe mode may be too sensitive. Recommend making this configurable.
- ⚠️ `inject_nan_random` and `inject_inf_random` allow duplicate coordinate collisions when `count` exceeds tensor size. The returned `coords` vec may have fewer unique entries than `count`.
- ⚠️ `inject_inf_random` only injects `+INFINITY`, not `NEG_INFINITY`. The manual injection tests cover negative infinity, but the API doesn't.

**Verdict:** Fit for production with the noted caveats on safe-mode sensitivity and duplicate injection handling.

### 5.3 `src/types.rs` — FeatureTensor, Symmetry Markers

**Findings:**

- ✅ All public message types have `Serialize + Deserialize` where feasible. `SaepConstraint` correctly omits it (contains `CheckFn` closure).
- ✅ `detect_non_finite`, `mask_non_finite` operate correctly on `Array3<f32>`.
- ✅ `SymmetryAlert` is well-structured with `tickers: Vec<String>` and `score: f64`.
- ⚠️ No explicit `FeatureTensor` type alias exists despite references in comments.
- ⚠️ Float precision inconsistency: `MatrixSnapshot.eigenvectors` uses `Array2<f64>` while `SliceUpdate.data` uses `Array2<f32>`.

**Verdict:** Types are production-ready. Minor consistency notes for future refactoring.

### 5.4 `src/lib.rs` — Module Structure, Visibility, API Surface

**Findings:**

- ✅ `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` present and enforced.
- ✅ All module declarations now have doc comments **(was missing, FIXED)**.
- ✅ Prelude exports all major types needed by consumers.
- ✅ Crate-level re-exports (`pub use`) mirror the prelude with trait aliases.
- ⚠️ `chaos`, `cli`, `mock_matrix`, `ternary_bridge` modules are public but not re-exported at crate level. They are accessible via module paths (e.g., `hybrid_bridge::mock_matrix::MockMatrixEngine`).

**Verdict:** Sound module structure. Re-export gaps are minor and don't affect downstream usability.

### 5.5 `src/ternary_bridge.rs` — Ternary ↔ Hybrid Mapping

**Findings:**

- ✅ **Excellent test coverage** — 50+ tests covering all edge cases.
- ✅ Hysteresis deadband logic is sound with rate-of-change guards.
- ✅ Portfolio-to-trit SAEP-aware encoding is correct.
- ✅ Consensus computation is mathematically sound with confidence weighting.
- ✅ Weight interpolation (linear & confidence modes) works correctly.
- ⚠️ `TernaryBridgeError::WeightOutOfRange` is defined but never used in current code — weight clamping happens internally.

**Verdict:** Production-ready. Strongest-tested module in the crate.

## 6. Doc Comments Audit

All public module declarations in `lib.rs` now have doc comments **(FIXED during this review)**.

| Module | Had doc comment | Current status |
|--------|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| `bridge` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `chaos` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `cli` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `datafeed` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `engine` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `error` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `mock_matrix` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `mock_room` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `mock_veto` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `ternary_bridge` | ❌ | ✅ Added |
| `types` | ❌ | ✅ Added |

Prelude (`pub mod prelude`) and individual type-level doc comments are already comprehensive across the crate. All public struct methods and functions have doc comments.

---

## 7. New Test: Full Pipeline

A comprehensive full-pipeline integration test was added at:

`tests/full_pipeline_test.rs` — `test_full_pipeline_matrix_rooms_veto_narrative`

**What it verifies (7 phases):**

| Phase | What | Validates |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Matrix Setup & Cycle | Snapshot tick, topology count, condition number, regime |
| 2 | Room Analysis + Narratives | Proposal volume, unique narrative sigs, invariant ranges |
| 2b | Symmetry Alerts | Room agent handles symmetry alert call |
| 3 | Veto Resolution | Portfolio positions, exposure bounds, severity ranges |
| 4 | Bridge Communication | Snapshot broadcast, proposal submission, portfolio broadcast, metrics |
| 5 | Ternary Bridge Round-Trip | Portfolio→TritVector→Weights, consensus computation |
| 6 | Freeze/Unfreeze Cycle | Frozen veto returns empty, unfrozen veto processes normally |
| 7 | Final Metrics Verification | Counter integrity across pipeline |

**Result:** ✅ Passed.

## 8. Summary

### ✅ Strengths
- **Zero unsafe code** — `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` provides a strong safety guarantee.
- **148/148 tests passing** — Comprehensive coverage across unit, integration, CLI, and full pipeline.
- **Clean clippy** — Zero warnings, zero lints.
- **Complete type coverage** — All major data types are `Serialize + Deserialize`.
- **Excellent ternary bridge** — Well-tested, mathematically sound consensus logic.
- **Async runtime safe** — Tokio broadcast/mpsc channels with backpressure.

### 🔧 Fixes Applied During This Review
1. **`Cargo.toml`**: Added missing `authors` field.
2. **`src/engine.rs`**: Replaced `blocking_read()` with `read().await` in `DefaultVetoEngine::get_portfolio()` — critical async correctness fix.
3. **`src/lib.rs`**: Added doc comments to all 11 `pub mod` declarations.
4. **`tests/full_pipeline_test.rs`**: New 7-phase full-pipeline integration test (Matrix → Rooms → Veto → Bridge → Ternary → Freeze → Metrics).

### ⚠️ Medium-Severity Notes (Deferred)
1. **Semaphore is inert** in `HybridEngineImpl::phase_rooms()` — permits are acquired sequentially, never constraining concurrent room analysis. Fix requires `tokio::spawn` fan-out.
2. **`SAFE_MODE_THRESHOLD = 1`** is overly aggressive for production with large tensors. Consider a configurable percentage-based threshold.
3. **`inject_inf_random`** only injects +INFINITY, missing NEG_INFINITY coverage.

### 💡 Minor Recommendations
- Add a `pub type FeatureTensor = Array3<f32>` alias for API clarity.
- Standardize on `f32` or `f64` for tensor data across all snapshot types.
- Implement `sync::OnceLock` or lazy init for the `CHAOS_RNG` to avoid extra allocations.
- Add `chaos`, `cli` key types to the prelude for consumer convenience.
