## Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` on GitHub. These are small,
well-defined tasks that are great for getting familiar with the codebase.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure `cargo test` passes
5. Ensure `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes
6. Ensure `cargo fmt -- --check` passes
7. Submit a pull request

## Coding Standards

- **Rust**: Use `anyhow` for application errors, `thiserror` for library errors. No `unwrap()` in production code.
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use type hints. Keep the sidecar stateless.
- **Documentation**: All public items must have rustdoc comments.
- **Tests**: Every new feature should include at least one test.

## Architecture

See [README.md](README.md) for the architecture overview and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for architecture decision records.
